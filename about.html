<h1><font face="courier" size="6px" color="#39FF14">About Sara Solutions</font></h1>

<h1><font face="courier" size="9px" color="#39FF14">STATEMENT OF PURPOSE</font></h1>
<p> <span face="courier" size="9px" style="background-color:#f4c2c2;"> I am a musician and artist from Amsterdam. My work is mainly expressed into video clips and other sound based video’s. As a music video maker, I often collaborate with musicians in order to create the perfect sphere to express their music. In this collaboration, there are moments I need to compromise, but the combination of moving image and sound something I find super important, and it always completes each other. No image without sound, No music without image. When I am on stage myself, I find it interesting to differentiate between the persona I’m performing as, who the audience perceives and who I really am.</span></p>

<p> <span face="courier" size="9px" style="background-color:#f4c2c2;">I want to be on stage, but don’t always feel very comfortable. How do I act? How do I want to be seen? And how do people look at me? This leaves a big discussion about identity, social behaviour and confusion. As a musician on tour, I have encountered a lot of weird situations, especially connected to sexism within the music industry. I see from up close, but also from a distance, how people who don’t fit the stereo-rock culture of machoism and aggression, are treated different. No, I’m not the singer of the band!</span></p>

<p> <span face="courier" size="9px" style="background-color:#f4c2c2;">My work is energetic and dramatic in aesthetic. I don’t like to beat around the bush. The narrative can be absurd, but it has to be emotionally driven. And since my music and video work is often a collaboration, I want it to be a shared experience otherwise no-one can relate. I make my characters act often as how I would act in extreme situations. This creates an over the top expression of topics that I think that matter. </span></p>
